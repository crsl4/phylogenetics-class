## Phylogenetic Analysis of Molecular Data (UW-Madison)

A course in the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference from DNA sequence data. Students will learn all the necessary components of state-of-the-art phylogenomic analyses and apply the knowledge to the data analyses of their own organisms.

- Spring 2025: Tuesday and Thursday 1:00-2:15pm
- Instructor: Claudia Solis-Lemus, PhD 
    - Email: solislemus@wisc.edu
    - Website: [https://solislemuslab.github.io/](https://solislemuslab.github.io/)
- Office hours: Tuesday 2:15-3:15pm, or by appointment


## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to

1. Explain in details all the steps in the pipeline for phylogenetic inference and how different data and model choices affect the inference outcomes
2. Plan and produce reproducible scripts with the analysis of your own biological data
3. Justify the data and model choices in your own data analysis
4. Interpret the results of the most widely used phylogenetic methods in biological terms
5. Orally present the results of your own phylogenomic data analyses based on the best scientific and reproducibility practices
