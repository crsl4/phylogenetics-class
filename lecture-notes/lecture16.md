# What do we know now?

- Motivation: phylogenomics pipeline
    - Reading: HAL 2.1
- Intro Illumina, quality control, assembly, alignment, filtering
- Alignment
    - Reading: HAL 2.2, ClustalW, MUSCLE, T-coffee papers
    - Software: T-coffee, Clustal, Muscle
- Orthology detection
    - Reading: HAL 2.4, Nichio 2017
    - Software: Many options in class google slides!
- Overview of phylogenetic inference: criteria score, search in tree space
- Gene tree estimation
    1. Distance methods
        - Reading (supplemental): HB Ch 5, Baum Ch 8
        - Software: R packages ape, phangorn
    2. Parsimony methods
        - Reading (supplemental): HB Ch 8, Baum Ch 7
        - Software: R packages ape, phangorn
    3. Models of evolution
        - Reading: HAL 1.1
    4. Maximum likelihood
        - Reading: HAL 1.2, RAxML and IQ-Tree papers
        - Software: RAxML (HAL 1.3) and IQ-Tree
    5. Bayesian
        - Reading: HAL 1.4, Mascimento 2017, MrBayes papers
        - Software: MrBayes (HB Ch 7)
    6. Model selection (invited guest: Rob Lanfear developer of IQ-Tree)
- Species tree/network estimation: the coalescent model
    - Reading: HAL 3.1, 3.3, ASTRAL and BUCKy papers
    - Software: PhyloNetworks wiki pipeline (MDL, RAxML, MrBayes, BUCKy, ASTRAL, SNaQ)
- Co-estimation methods
    - Reading: BEAST papers
    - Taming the BEAST slides


## Main conclusions

- Phylogenomics is hard
- Importance of data quality and phylogenetic signal
- Importance of clear description of methods used, assumptions and limitations
  - Make sure that you know (in general) what the method you are using does
- Importance of model selection and model fit
- Importance of measures of confidence
  - No desperate quest for 100 bootstrap support values!
- Importance of reproducibility
  - Every choice matters, so keep good track of the choices
  
## Good news

- This was not the class to make you all experts in phylogenetics
- Class notes are publicly available on github forever
- Upcoming: lecture YouTube videos publicly available (Spring 2024)
- You have now your own notes in your personal github repository
- You can continue to have support from phylogenetics student community in slack (if you choose to remain in the workspace)
