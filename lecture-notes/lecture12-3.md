# Bayesian Inference (Part 3: computer lab)

**Instructions:** Run MrBayes on the toy dataset described below. You can use my reproducible script as guideline: [notebook-log.md](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/tree/master/exercises/notebook-log.md).


New toy dataset (`algaemb.nex`) in the `data` folder.


You can also use the primates fasta file that you aligned with ClustalW, MUSCLE or T-Coffee.

After the computer lab, make sure to read the [MrBayes tutorial](https://github.com/gdw-workshop/2018_GDW_Workshop/blob/master/exercises/MrBayesTutorial.md) carefully to determine the appropriate MrBayes block for your data.

**Bonus points** for paying attention to the importants aspects that affect the performance of the chosen method.

{: .important }
**Double bonus points** for comparing how do results differ if we use an alignment from a different method. That is, `primatesAA-aligned-muscle.fasta` are the aligned sequences with MUSCLE. I can run MrBayes on this file and on `primatesAA-aligned.fasta` which was aligned with ClustalW and compare with the estimated trees.
