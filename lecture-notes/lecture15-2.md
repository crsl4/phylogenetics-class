### Previous class check-up
- We studied the co-estimation method in BEAST

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- explain in details the BEAST inference methods
- use BEAST software


### Pre-class work (optional)

- Read the papers:
  - BEAST 1: [Drummond and Rambaut, 2007](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-7-214)
  - BEAST 2: [Bouckaert et al 2019](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006650)



# In-class dynamic: Taming the BEAST tutorial


Instructions: Choose a tutorial from the whole list of [BEAST tutorials](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/). Two that stand out: 

- [Intro to BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-BEAST2/)
- [Multispecies coalescent on *BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/StarBeast-Tutorial/)

Create our own reproducible script.

{: .note }
I still have not added these steps to the reproducible script: [notebook-log.md](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/tree/master/exercises/notebook-log.md).


{: .important }
**Take-home message:** always read carefully the paper and the documentation of any phylogenetic method you use

{: .note }
Create your own [cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md) with description, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions and user choices (and other things you find relevant).

# Further learning

# Announcements

## Final project (deadline coming up)

- Final project: 50 points out of 100 total points.
- Reproducible script(s) on your github repo: 10 points out of 100 total points
- Final presentation: 10 points out of 100 total points

Final project content:
- Abstract: 200 words or less
- Introduction: convey the background, objective and significance of your analysis
- Materials and Methods: describe in details the data and the different methods, software, assumptions or any methodological - choices that you did; appropriately cite other papers or software used
  - Use the Methods section in [Yi et al (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33607033/) as a template of how to write the Methods section in your project
- Results: clearly and effectively describe the results of your analysis
- Discussion: summarize the conclusion of your findings and highlight any weaknesses or limitations of your approach
- References
- Reproducible script: step-by-step description of the methodology that can be easily followed by others. This file should be part of the github repository


Some comments:
- There are no page restrictions (based on last year, average of 8-10 pages)
- In the Methods section, it is not enough to write "we used X, Y, and Z". For every software, you should write (not with this wording necessarily):

_We used X (reference) which [short description of the methodology]. We chose X because [short description of strengths]. We know that X has the following limitations [short description of weaknesses] and that it has the main following assumptions [short description of the assumptions]. The software X requires the user to input the following parameters: [parameter/user choices selected]_

- No specific file format: latex, markdown, Rmarkdown, google docs, word
- [Final project guidelines](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/syllabus.md#final-project-guidelines)


## Final presentations (on last week of classes)

- Final presentation is 7 minutes long (very strict!)
- Students divided in the two dates
- We meet in class as usual
- Students unable to attend in person due to exam or travel conflicts can choose to present remotely or to submit a video recording of their presentation


## Student evaluations

- Forward me the email after completion of the evaluation and it will count as one HW
  - Note that the email does not have information on your answers
- I have my own short survey to help me improve the class (on the last class)
