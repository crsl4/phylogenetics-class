# Sequencing HW

## Part 1: Wrap up class work

**Objective:** Read more about UCEs and continue working on phyluce or FastQC.

**Instructions:**

1. Read [Zhang et al, 2019](https://academic.oup.com/isd/article/3/5/3/5573097) (optional due to paywall)
2. Two options:
    - Continue with the [phyluce tutorial I](https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-one.html)
    - Continue learning how to use [FASTQC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-andrews/FastQC/master/README.txt)

**Deadline:** No deadline. Completion of this HW is not evaluated.

## Part 2: Choosing your data and performing QC

**Objective:** Select the data that you will use for the rest of the semester and begin with QC steps.

**Instructions:**

1. Identify which dataset you will use for the rest of the semester: This data can be related to your research or it can be a public dataset
2. Create your reproducible notebook (preferably md format, for example `notebook-log.md`)
3. Add a short description of your dataset to your notebook and add one slide describing your dataset to share with the class in the [class google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UW6P5wVKcDLwVLoshnJ2ilTbrsUEPFoH1MTXppQcpAc/edit?usp=sharing)
4. Identify the stage of your dataset
    - Do you have raw reads? Perform the quality control steps with FastQC
    - Do you have UCEs? Use `phyluce` for quality control, assembly and mapping
    - Feel free to use other QC software if you include a description of what they do
5. Make sure to record all steps taken with the data in your reproducible notebook and push the most updated version to github
6. Submit the link to your commit in canvas

**Deadline:** February 18th, 2022 2:30pm CT
