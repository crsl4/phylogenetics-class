# Notebook reproducible script for Botany 563 (Spring 2021)

## Alignment methods

### ClustalW

1. Downloaded [ClustalW](http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/) file `clustalw-2.1-macosx.dmg` and copied the folder into `Dropbox/software`

2. Downloaded the `primatesAA.fasta` file from the Phylogenetic Handbook [website](https://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogenybook/Data_sets.html). I had to copy and paste the sequences into a file with the same name

```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/teaching/phylogenetics-class/BOT563/data
grep ">" primatesAA.fasta | wc -l ## 22
```

3. We find the running commands in the [docs](http://www.clustal.org/download/clustalw_help.txt)

4. We run the command

```shell
$ ~/Dropbox/software/clustalw-2.1-macosx/clustalw2 -ALIGN -INFILE=primatesAA.fasta -OUTFILE=primatesAA-aligned.fasta -OUTPUT=PHYLIP

### MUSCLE

1. Downloaded [MUSCLE](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm) with file `muscle3.8.31_i86darwin64.tar.gz`

2. Move to software and untar:
```shell
mv ~/Downloads/muscle3.8.31_i86darwin64.tar.gz ~/Dropbox/software/
cd ~/Dropbox/software/
tar -zxvf muscle3.8.31_i86darwin64.tar.gz
```
This produces the executable directly: `muscle3.8.31_i86darwin64`

3. Run MUSCLE on the primate data:
```shell
cd Dropbox/Documents/teaching/phylogenetics-class/BOT563/data
~/Dropbox/software/muscle3.8.31_i86darwin64 -in primatesAA.fasta -out primatesAA-aligned-muscle.fasta
